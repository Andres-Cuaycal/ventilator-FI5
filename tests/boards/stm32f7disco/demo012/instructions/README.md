This demo is the result of tests done for demo of 11 may





## Results



The behaviour of the ventilator is almost compliant.

Now we use the four buttons to change mode and we use the knobs to change parameters  `FREQvalue`, `PMAXvalue`, `IERvalue` and `TIDVOLvalue`.

We have also integrated a new controller which fixes spurious starts.



To do:

- fix the LEDs which are not driven correctly (always off). maybe they are not connected.
- integrate the matlab-generated state machine.
- clean and migrate the demos into a single application
