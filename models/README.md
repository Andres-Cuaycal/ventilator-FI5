Modeling
========

We do use the model of the human lungs proposed by [Mesic _et al._ (2003)](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/ventilator/blob/doc/papers/mesic-2003.pdf).

In particular, we follow two concurrent modeling approaches that are based on different toolchains:
- **Simulink** (version R2017b)
- **Simscape** (version R2020a)
