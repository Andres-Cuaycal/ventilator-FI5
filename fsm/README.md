FSM Design
==========

The [Finite-State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) (FSM) has been implemented in Stateflow for fast-prototyping the code. The FSM is responsible for handling the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) in terms of buttons, knobs, multiselector and the LED's as well as for handling the alarms.

More details can be found in [**`FI5 technical specifications`**](../../design/FI5-specs.pdf).
